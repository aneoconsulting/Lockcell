how to use :

- State which calculus you want to make via launcher.py (format = [size : int, problems : 'list[tuple(list, int)]', waiting_time : float, force_the_computation : bool])
- launch via main.py to compute, cache system makes that you don't do a calculus that you have already done (except if force_the_computation = True)
- print via print_graph.py (filter system etc to print a lot of things (look a the body to understand better))
